# AI-Powered Product Recommendation Engine - Submission

## Project Summary

I've built a full-stack AI product recommendation system that uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo to generate personalized product recommendations based on user preferences, liked products, and browsing history. The system features a clean, responsive frontend interface with filtering capabilities and a backend API with optimized prompt engineering, with the addition of a mock API implementation in the case that the OpenAI API is down. 

## Backend Implementation

For the backend, I developed a FastAPI application with the following components:

- **Secure API Key Management**: Implemented environment variable-based API key handling to improve security and configuration flexibility
- **Advanced Prompt Engineering**: Created a structured prompt template that effectively communicated user preferences, product details, and required response formats to the LLM
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Implemented a reliable mock recommendation engine that activates when API calls fail, ensuring uninterrupted service
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Built thorough error handling that manages API limitations, parsing issues, and unexpected inputs

The prompt engineering was particularly challenging. My initial approach simply provided the LLM with user data and product data, but this led to inconsistent recommendations. I refined the prompt through several iterations, eventually creating a structured format with explicitly detailed instructions and examples. This significantly improved recommendation quality and explanation consistency. 

## Frontend Implementation

The frontend React application includes:

- **Intuitive User Interface**: Created a clean, modern interface with clear visual hierarchies that guide users through the product discovery process naturally
- **Interactive Product Cards**: Designed engaging product cards with visual feedback for likes, clear product information, and accessibility features
- **Filtering System**: Developed an intuitive filtering mechanism that updates in real-time as users select preferences
- **Visual Feedback Mechanisms**: Added loading states, success/error notifications, and transition animations that provide users with clear feedback about system status
- **Modal-Based Recommendations**: Created an elegant modal presentation for recommendations that focuses user attention on personalized suggestions

My UI/UX approach evolved significantly during development. Initially, I created a functionally-focused interface with basic styling, but I realized that to truly demonstrate the value of AI recommendations, the presentation needed refinement. I iteratively improved the interface by:

1. Centralizing state management to have a single source of truth for all UI elements
2. Implementing a more intuitive filtering system that updates in real-time
3. Adding meaningful transitions and animations to improve perceived performance
4. Enhancing visual feedback through notifications and status indicators
5. Improving accessibility with proper contrast ratios, focus states, and semantic HTML
6. Optimizing layout for different viewport sizes to ensure a consistent experience across devices

These improvements created a more engaging, intuitive shopping experience that effectively showcases the AI recommendation system's capabilities.


## Some Challenges & Solutions

1. **OpenAI API Integration**: Encountered challenges with OpenAI client initialization and proxies configuration. Resolved by studying the provided OpenAI documentation. This issue inspired my creation of the mock API implementation in order to have consistent results when the OpenAI API is not working.

2. **Category Filtering Inconsistency**: Initially, category selection didn't properly filter products. Fixed this by refactoring the filter logic to properly update and apply preferences across components.

3. **Recommendation Quality**: Early recommendations lacked relevance and consistency. Improved this by iteratively refining the prompt engineering with more explicit instructions, format requirements, and specific constraints about recommendation diversity.

4. **Error Handling**: Originally, API failures would break the user experience. Implemented a graceful fallback system using mock recommendations that ensures users always receive quality suggestions regardless of API status.

## Performance Optimizations

- Used React.useMemo for computationally expensive filtering operations
- Implemented a product catalog caching mechanism to reduce API calls
- Structured prompts to minimize token usage while maximizing recommendation quality(this took a while)
- Added thorough input validation to prevent unnecessary API calls with invalid data

This project has been an invaluable experience that pushed me to utilize my technical skills in both frontend and backend development. While I was faced with knowledge gaps along the way, particularly with API integration and advanced React patterns, I viewed these as opportunities for growth rather than obstacles. Through researching documentation, studying best practices, and trial and error, I was able to deliver a fully functional application that meets all requirements.

I'm grateful to i95Dev for the opportunity to work on this challenging assignment alongside my academic commitments. I look forward to hearing back regarding the AI Engineering Intern position and to get feedback on my implementation.
